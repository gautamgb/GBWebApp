          |"Alec is one of the most driven front-end developers I've ever worked with. He spends time outside of work honing his craft, teaching himself new skills and going above and beyond in his projects. He understands interfaces from a design perspective and cares about pixel perfection. In addition to all of this, Alec is an amazing personality to have on a team - witty, hardworking and thoughtful."

What I enjoyed most about working with Alec was how committed to the team he is. There was never a task that he wouldn't roll up his sleeves and get done. I would recommend Alec without question, knowing any team he joins will be lucky to have him."
